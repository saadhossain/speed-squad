                    <h3>Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage</h3>
                    <p class="blog-description">
                        <span class="code">Local Storage</span> data has no expiration time. It store at your browser memory until you manually clear data. <br><br>
                        The keys and the values stored with localStorage are always in the UTF-16 string format, which uses two bytes per character. As with objects, integer keys are automatically converted to strings.

                        <br><br>
                        <span class="code">Session Storage</span> Data store at browser memory same as local Storage, but in the term of session storage data will be cleared every time you close the tabe or window.<br>
                        Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab. That page session is valid only for that particular tab.
                        <br><br>
                        The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                    <h3>Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope</h3>
                    <p class="blog-description">
                        <span class="code">Global Scope</span> Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.<br>
                        Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.<br><br>
                        Variables declared with <span class="code">var, let</span> and <span class="code">const</span> are quite similar when declared outside a block.<br><br>
                        <span class="code">Block Scope</span> Variable declared in a function is a block scope variable. I can't access outside of the function.<br><br>
                        ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: <span class="code">let</span> and <span class="code">const</span>. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.<br><br>
                        Variables declared with the <span class="code">var</span> keyword, do not have block scope.

                        There are some common case, we may get undefiened output from our code.<br><br>

                    <h3>Describe: How Event Loop Works</h3>
                    <p class="blog-description">
                        JavaScript has a runtime model based on an <span class="code">event loop</span>, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.<br><br>
                        The browser is then set up to listen for the response from the network, and when it has something to return to you, it will schedule the <span class="code">callback function</span> to be executed by inserting it into the event loop.<br><br>
                        The <span class="code">Event Loop</span> has one simple job â€” to monitor the <span class="code">Call Stack</span> and the Callback <span class="code">Queue</span>. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
                        Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.
